# Welcome to Hafly

Hafly is a simple, beginner-friendly scripting language designed so that it can be embedded in larger projects written in the Haskell programming language so that users who do not nescsarialy have a strong background in software development can customize and extend those projects to their own needs.

For a basic tutorial that does not assume any prior background in software development, see the tutorial page in the side-bar.

To learn about how to incorporate hafly into your own projects as a Haskell developer, see the developer guide.
