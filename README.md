hafly (pronounced "half-lee") is a simple dynamic embeddable scripting language in Haskell.

See [hafly-web-repl](https://github.com/Sintrastes/hafly-web-repl) for a repo implementing an embeddable hafly REPL.

# Why?

I wanted a simple, easy to learn scripting language that was easy to embed in pure Haskell projects (so it's easy to target, for instance, ghcjs as well as native targets) that still meshes well with Haskell idioms. (Simple expression language + a monadic block syntax that can be interpreted in an arbitrary monad? Hell yeah!) As far as I could tell, such a thing did not exist -- so I made one!

Comparison with other projects:

  * [hslua](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hslua): Easy for beginners, embeddable, yet is not pure haskell (hard to use in GHCJS).
  * [codeworld](https://github.com/google/codeworld) haskell: Possibly another good option in this space -- an educational variant of Haskell that can be run in GHCJS.
  * [hint](https://github.com/haskell-hint/hint): Very nice -- yet pretty heavyweight, and Haskell itself is not nescesarialy the easiest for beginners.
  * Various lisp/scheme implementations: Maybe not the easiest to embed. Arguably not the most intuitive syntax for beginners. Too dissimilar to Haskell.

# Why dynamically typed?

I wanted something quick and no-nonsense (implementation-wise), and easy to extend with arbitrary Haskell types and functions without mucking about with a bunch of singletons and/or type families -- building a dynamic language at first seemed like the easiest way to do that.

Given sufficent time (and/or interested contributors!) I'll probably add optional static type checking capabilities in the future.

# Features / Progress

 * [x] Higher-order functions
 * [x] Everything is an expression
 * [x] Recursion
 * [x] What if Haskell... but with a Rust-like monadic syntax thrown in for good measure? (But I might add whitespace sensitivity later, IDK)

# Examples

## Recursive Function Definitions

```haskell
fact = \n -> if(n == 0) 1 
    else n * fact (n - 1)
```

## Function Application Operator

```haskell
squared = \x -> x * x

> squared $ squared 2.5
39.0625
```

## Function Composition

```haskell
f = \x -> x + 2
g = \x -> x * 5

h  = g of f
h' = f then g

> h 1
15

> h' 1
15
```

## Uniform Function Call Syntax

```haskell
squared = \x -> x * x

> 4.squared
8

> 2.5.squared.squared
39.0625
```

## ML-like References (Mutable Variables)

```haskell
main = {
    x <- var 0;
    printLn "The value of x is $x.";
    printLn "Enter in a new value for x.";
    newValue <- readLn then toInt;
    x := newValue;
    printLn "The value of x is now $x."
}
```

## Scheduling Task

```haskell
-- Interperted in a monad allowing for the scheduling of 
-- actions in IO.
remindMe time timeToRemindAgain todo = schedule time {
    result <- prompt "Don't forget! $todo";
    case result {
        Ok -> done;
        Cancel -> {
            schedule timeToRemindAgain {
                remindMe timeToRemindAgain timeToRemindAgain todo
            }
        };
    }
}
```

## User Interface

```haskell
-- Interpreted in a "builder" monad for a UI.
-- builds up a record of the form:
--    [ name: "bob", age: 42 ]
entryForm = Column {
    Row {
        Text "Name: ";
        nameEntry <- TextEntry
            .bind name
    };
    Row {
        Text "Age: ";
        ageEntry <- TextEntry
            .bind age
    }
}
```

# Do Notation++ (WIP)

```haskell
UI = Column {
    Row {
        Text "Click the button:";
        button <- Button ":)"
    };
    
    when button.clicked {
        popupDialog "You clicked the button!"
    }
}
```

is equivalent to the following:

```haskell
UI = Column {
    button <- Row {
        Text "Click the button:";
        button <- Button ":)";
        return button
    };
    
    -- Variables in nexted monadic blocks are automatically accessible in parent scopes
    when button.clicked {
        popupDialog "You clicked the button!"
    }
}
```

## Reactive Polymorphism (WIP)

Let's say you have a type of reactive state variables `State a` which is a functor (in Hafly terms, we've defined a `map` operator for it via multiple dispatch), and a `state : a -> m (State a)` to introduce them in some monad `m`. Hafly can automatically `map` and `bind` operations over `State`s without extra ceremony:

```haskell
UI = Column {
    count <- state 0
    
    btn <- Button "Click me!"
    
    when btn.clicked {
        count := count + 1
    }
    
    Text "You clicked me $count times!"
}
```

Compare with the "manual" version, where we have to apply `map` rather than directly operating over the `State`:

```haskell
UI = Column {
    count <- state 0
    
    btn <- Button "Click me!"
    
    when btn.clicked {
        count := count + 1
    }
    
    btnText = count.map $ \num ->
        "You clicked me $num times!"
    
    Text btnText
}
```

How does it work?
-----------------

To set up your own embedded interpreter, you need to build an `InterpreterContext` -- which contains all the data (such as "built-in" functions and operators) needed to interpret a hafly program. Hafly comes with an optional `base :: InterpreterContext` "standard library" of sorts that you can use to get started -- but this can be customized to your own needs.

Once you have that, with `interpret :: InterpreterContext -> Ast -> Either TypeError Dynamic` you can take a hafly `Ast` and interpret it as a `Dynamic` value from `Data.Dynamic`. You can then attempt to grab a value of some concrete Haskell type out of that `Dynamic` with `Data.Dynamic`'s `fromDynamic`.

Hafly comes with a few built-in functions for interpreting hafly programs in specific contexts. For instance, `interpretIO` can be used to interpret a hafly program representing an IO action.
